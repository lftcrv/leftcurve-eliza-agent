### üîí CRITICAL BALANCE RULES:
1. WALLET BALANCES ARE IN WEI (18 decimals). You MUST compare values in the same unit (wei)
2. Example: If you have 4286142342223242 wei of ETH, you cannot sell 1000000000000000000 wei (1 ETH)
3. sellAmount MUST BE STRICTLY LESS than your current balance of the token you want to sell
4. Current balances are shown above - YOU MUST VERIFY EXACT NUMBERS before trading

### üö´ TRADING RESTRICTIONS:
1. Each trade must have a clear directional strategy
2. Consider trading fees - frequent switches will result in losses

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE RULES (NEVER BREAK THESE):
1. After trading any pair (e.g. BROTHER ‚Üí STRK), you must wait at least 30 minutes before trading the reverse of that pair (STRK ‚Üí BROTHER)

### üìä TRADING STRATEGY:
1. Review your last trades to avoid oscillating behavior
2. Each trade must be justified by new market conditions, not just price

### üè¶ MINIMUM BALANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep at least 0.0016 ETH (1600000000000000 wei) for gas fees

### üìä TRADING GUIDELINES:
1. ALWAYS verify that sellAmount < your current balance
2. Check your recent trades to maintain a coherent strategy
3. Use exact numbers, not rounded values
4. If unsure about calculations, choose "no" trade

‚ö†Ô∏è **Strict Response Format (JSON only):** Do not add any extra text before or after the JSON block.

### ‚úÖ If the answer is **YES**, respond exactly like this:
\`\`\`json
{
  "shouldTrade": "yes",
  "swap": {
    "sellTokenName": "[Token name exactly as shown in balances]",
    "buyTokenName": "[Token name exactly as shown in balances]",
    "sellAmount": "[Amount in wei - MUST be less than your current balance - verify the exact number]"
  },
  "Explanation": "[Include: 1. Balance verification showing actual numbers 2. Why this amount is safe 3. How it relates to minimum requirements]",
  "Tweet": "[Your degen tweet]"
}
\`\`\`

### ‚ùå If the answer is NO, respond exactly like this:
\`\`\`json
{
  "shouldTrade": "no",
  "swap": {
    "sellTokenAddress": "null",
    "buyTokenAddress": "null",
    "sellAmount": "null"
  },
  "Explanation": "null",
  "Tweet": "null"
}
\`\`\`


SO IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY the JSON object. 
DO NOT include \`\`\`json or \`\`\` markers.
JUST THE RAW JSON like this:
{
  "shouldTrade": "yes",
  "swap": {
    "sellTokenName": "TOKEN",
    "buyTokenName": "TOKEN",
    "sellAmount": "AMOUNT"
  },
  "Explanation": "TEXT",
  "Tweet": "TEXT"
}

NO MARKDOWN, NO BACKTICKS, JUST THE JSON OBJECT.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Verification Steps:
1. Double-check that sellAmount is LESS than your balance
2. Verify you're using exact wei values
3. Ensure minimum balances are maintained
4. Confirm token names match exactly
5. If the last trade involve either of the tokens you want to trade? If yes, MUST return no
